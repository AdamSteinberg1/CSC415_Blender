# Blender Fluid Simulation
### Adam Steinberg
#### A CSC 415 Simulation project demonstrating how to use Blender to model fluids.

`MainLiquidSim.blend` is the main Blender file where all the editing is performed.  
`cache` is a folder generated by Blender. In general humans don't have to interact with it.  
`out` is the folder containing all rendered video files.  

This Blender project has only been tested on Blender version 2.92. It may not work correctly on earlier versions.
